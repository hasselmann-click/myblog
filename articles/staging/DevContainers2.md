# Dev Containers Without VS Code
In my last post I kind of raved about dev containers and I'm still a big fan. But I also looked at it with their tight integration in VS Code through its DevContainer Extension **link**. And now I wanted to try [Cursor](https://www.trycursor.com/), an "AI first" code editor. 
Since this is a fork of VS code the DevContainer Extension might work eventually, but currently there appear to be some versioning issues. **SOURCE**
